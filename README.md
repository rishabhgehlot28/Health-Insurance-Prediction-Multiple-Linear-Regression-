# Health-Insurance-Prediction-Multiple-Linear-Regression-
•	Performed Exploratory Data Analysis on the Health Insurance dataset contains 1338 data points and 7 features
•	Obtaining the better fitted linear model for data by eliminating insignificant features using backward elimination technique [p-value approach] on the training data
•	Checked the assumptions of linear regression such as Multicollinearity, Normality of errors, Autocorrelation and Homoscedasticity using VIF, Q-Q plots, Durbin Watson test and residual vs fitted plot
•	Achieved adjusted R square = 0.750 on test data and validated the results using k-fold Cross validation technique
